  				<img src="Assets/Images/teron.png" alt="Screenshot of Teron"><p>Teron is the starting location in the game. It is a small city ruled by Lord Antidas and his soldiers. The Lord is the last living member of his blood-line and he feels pressured into rebuilding his House old reputation, therefore he is reckless in his decisions and undertakes unnecessary risk. This citys job is to show and make the player familiar with game mechanics. If you wander into dodgy alley, the chances are you are not going to have a nice time.</p>

  				<img src="Assets/Images/mada.png" alt="Screenshot of Maadoran"><p>Maadoran was the city of the cities before the Empire fell. Now it still is the biggest city in the region, but its older glory is long gone. It is being governed by Lord Gaelius and his House, acting as the local superpower, like a scarecrow to remind raiders and reavers there is still someone who will go after them, even if the Empire is non-existent.</p>

			<button class="showButton">Ganezzar</button>
			<div class="hiddenContent">
				<img src="Assets/Images/ganz.png" alt="Screenshot of Ganezzar"><p>Ganezzar is the 3rd city that player will visit during the game. When the player arrives, the city is found overflowed with religious fanatics. Crucifixions and religious harassment have no end. Guards had to separate lower discrit from the upper district inhabited by the traders and nobles, but how long can they resist the mob?</p>
